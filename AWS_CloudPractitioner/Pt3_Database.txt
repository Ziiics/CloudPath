NoSQL Database Overview
- Non-relational databased that is uprpose built, don't have fixed pre-defined schema
- More flexible, scale horizontally instead of vertically

NoSQL Database Model
- Amazon DynamoDB - Key value
- Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) - for document, catalogs, json, user profile
- Amazon Neptune, Neo4j - graph, relationships, node, fraud detection
- Amazon ElastiCache, Amaxon DynamoDB Accelerator - eliminate time to access disk, microsecs responses
- Amazon Elasticsearch Service - for searhcing data content, indexes, and to categorize and analyze

SQL vs NoSQL Database
- SQL (Relational Database)
  - Optimal for transactional data, online transaction processing (OLTP), and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
  - Data model is based on row and column, schema
  - ACID properties - Atomicity, consistency, Isolation, durability
  - Vertical scaling
- NoSQL (NonRelational Databases)
  - Can be any type, as key value, graph, in memory, document, semi-structures data, etc
  - Provide ACID by using DynamoDB
  - Have high thoguhput and low latency
  - Horizontal Scaling, partitionable and distributed architecture
