Cloud Computing: the delivery of in-demand IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Users are able to rent computing power, storage, server, databases, AI, ML tools, etc
- The user also doesn't need to purchase hardware resources for it
- User is able to access resources within seconds through internet connectivity

Cloud deployment types
- On-cloud: all data is migrated to the cloud, and will utilize most of the cloud infrastructure
- On-premise: utilizes the least of cloud infrastructure and is used only to try to increase resource utilization
- Hybrid: using both on-cloud and on-premises, can also refer to multi-cloud reployment

AWS Global Infrastructure means that resources will all around. If a disaster happens, there is another one ready to pick up the slack. This makes the resources  highly available and fault-tolerant, and to build resiliency into applications.

AWS Shared Responsibility Model: Both the user and AWS are responsible for securing the cloud.
- User is in charge of their cloud security (encryption), operating system, and access to data.
- AWS will be responsible for the physical, network, and hypervisor layers.
- Depending on the service, server-side encryption, network traffic protection, and firewall responsibility can vary
